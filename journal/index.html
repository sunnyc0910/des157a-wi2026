               After reading “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,” I realized how often modals are used by default rather than intentionally. The author points out that modals were originally designed to simplify interfaces and save space, but over time they’ve started to feel more like modern pop-ups, something users instinctively try to close. This let me recall the memory of how many websites interrupt users with modals before they’ve even chosen to interact.

              <p>
                What stood out most was the emphasis on user control and accessibility. The idea of an “escape hatch” made me reflect on how frustrating it is when a modal lacks a clear close option or traps the user. The discussion of keyboard accessibility and focus management, which made me realize that a modal isn’t just a visual element, it’s an interaction system that must work for all users, not just mouse users.

                The article also changed how I think about using modals on mobile. I’ve often seen cramped, scroll-heavy modals on phones, and Baskanderi’s argument that modals and mobile don’t work well together helped explain why they feel so awkward.

                This week, I learned the basic structure of building forms in HTML, especially the importance of inputs and labels, as well as elements such as fieldset, legend, select, and textarea. Through practice examples, I began to understand how form structure can directly influence usability, user affordance, and help prevent user errors. In addition, how to set the default option and validation by using the “selected” and “required” attributes.

              </p>

                The article <em>Best Practices for Form Design</em> helped me connect these technical elements to user experience. One key takeaway was that good form design should reduce users’ cognitive load rather than make them think about how to fill out a form. The author emphasizes collecting only necessary information and choosing appropriate input types. For example, when a dropdown contains fewer than six options, radio buttons are often more effective because they make all choices visible and reduce interaction cost.

              <p>
                I chose Urban Outfitters’ “Edit Your Personal Information” as a good example, the one following the principles in the article. The form is clearly organized with labeled text inputs, dropdown menus for birthday selection, and radio buttons for the student status question. These choices make the form easy to understand and complete.
